## Dataset
In this project we will be working on a weather dataset (Weather.csv), containing temperatures from various years for months JAN to DEC.

## Project Objectives:
- Prepare a detailed python notebook using K-means Algorithm for predicting temperatures.
- Visualize the dataset. Plot graphs between various features to establish trends in data.
- Split up the data between training and testing set accordingly.
- Train the K-means Model on "training" set.
- Evaluate the Model on "testing" set. 
- Forecast monthly mean temperature.
